Restaurant profit prediction model
Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting restaurant using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate price estimations based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property-related attributes. This project was developed as part of a Coursera Machine Learning course, combining both data preprocessing and predictive modeling skills.

Dataset

The dataset includes multiple features that affect house prices, including:


Population of the city

Profit of the restaurant in the city


Other relevant property attributes

The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables, ensuring high model performance.

Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing data

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling for numerical data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing relationships between features and target

Detecting outliers and trends

Model Selection

Implemented multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression

Gradient Boosting Regression

Compared model performance using RMSE and R² metrics

Model Evaluation

Used train-test split for validation

Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve predictions

Results

The best-performing model achieved an R² score of X.XX and RMSE of XXXX, providing reliable Restaurant profit predictions.

Visualizations of predicted vs. actual prices show strong correlation, demonstrating model accuracy.

Technologies & Tools

Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
